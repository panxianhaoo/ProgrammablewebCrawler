{"Name": "Image Upscaler", "Desc": "Image Upscaler - https://imageupscaler.com - is a smart tool to upscale image without losing quality. When we work with image enlargement we usually meet problems with creating new pixels that have been added. Standard approach gives a blur effect in the image, if we estimate pixels as average of neighbouring pixels. And in that case the image looks like a stretched image and it has a blur effect. In the approach on Image Upscaler website we use Deep Learning GAN - generative adversarial network to approximate pixels. In this approach images save their quality, they have no blur effect and look more natural like in the real world if you take photos with a better camera or with smaller distance. At the first stage, GAN Generative Adversarial Networks have been trained on high photo databases. It helps the algorithm to understand how the natural object looks in real life. When you upload an image, AI Image Upscaler scans it, and generates new pixels for bigger images, and these pixels look like they should be in the real world. As a result, you get a higher resolution image.\nYou can upscale images in JPG, JPEG, PNG formats. Image Upscaler works with any image, but you will get a better result using photos that were not previously blurred or upscaled.
